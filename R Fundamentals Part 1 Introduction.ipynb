    "> D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as this one, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of topics and programming languages.\n",

    "Part 1) Introduction to R, data types, data structures (emphasis on data frame)\n",
    "Part 2) Importing, subsetting, and merging data; type coercion, identifying missing data\n",
    "Part 3) Research design, data exploration, and statistical testing\n",
    "Part 4) For-loops and functions; Monte Carlo simulation, the \"birthday problem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 learning objectives:\n",
    "1. Introduction: What is RStudio?, the basics, objects, global environment, packages, variable assignment, help\n",
    "2. Atomic data types: numeric, character, and logical\n",
    "3. Data type coercion\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The instructor\n",
    "**The instructor** should emphasize that:\n",
    "1) R is free and open-source\n",
    "2) is great for data visualizaiton\n",
    "3) utilizes many analytical packages written for your field\n",
    "4) is ideal for open and reproducible research\n",
    "5) has strong community support and help and is used by virtually all academic disciplines, business, and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the instructor will:\n",
    "1) provide a few motivating examples for the class\n",
    "2) describe how to apply R to social science research\n",
    "3) mention some of its pitfalls\n",
    "4) lead typing walkthoughs of these R commands\n",

    "### 1.3 R and RStudio\n",
    "R is a programming language based on the \"S\" and \"S-PLUS\" language and graphics user interface (GUI) and is **functional**, **object oriented**, and **interpreted**. These themes make R highly extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do not need to think of R in such complicated terms. In this workshop, we want to provide you with basic programming competencies so you can apply what you learn to your own research starting after Part 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio is an R GUI that permits the user to enter and save code and data pertaining to data preparation, exploration, plotting, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 The basics: Navigating RStudio\n",
    "Open RStudio! After opening a new script, you should see four window \"panes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open a new script**\n",
    "`*PC:* Ctrl + Shift + N`\n",
    "`*MAC:* command + shift + N`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top left pane**\n",
    "enter code in this savable `script` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom left pane**\n",
    "code output is displayed here in the `console`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top right pane**\n",
    "contains the defined objects currently in the `global environment` and command `history`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom right pane**\n",
    "contains file import/export, plot view, package installations, and help\n",
    "\n",
    "**control + 1, 2, 3, 4**\n",
    "will keyboard shortcut between these panes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run a line of code**\n",
    "`*MAC*: command + return`\n",
    "`*PC*: Ctrl + r`\n",
    "\n",
    "**To clear your console**\n",
    "NOTE: this will not erase any saved data - it will simply make your console easier to read.\n",
    "`*MAC*: control + l`\n",
    "`*PC*: Ctrl + l`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commenting your script file**\n",
    "Using a hashtag `#` will tell R that you do not want that particular line or block of code to be run. This is handy for making notes to yourself! You can even add hashtags after lines of runable code - on the same line!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The prompt**\n",
    "In the console, the prompt `>` looks like a greater than symbol. If your prompt begins to look like a `+` symbol by mistake, simply click in your console and press the `esc` key on your keyboard to return to `>`.\n",
    "R uses `+` when code is broken up across multiple lines and R is still expecting more code. A line of code does not usually stop until R finds an appropriate stop parameter, often a closed parenthesis `)`, closed bracket`]`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving your script**\n",
    "the name of your script file is in the tab at the top of your script window - the name defaults to `Untitled1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name is red and followed by an asterisk `*` it means **your script is not saved**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Save your script** by clicking \"File\" then \"Save\", or `command + s` (Mac) or `Ctrl + s` (PC).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Package installation\n",
    "Many people write clever software that makes R smarter/better/faster/stronger. You can install packages by clicking the \"Packages\" tab in the bottom-right window, clicking install, and then searching for the package you wish to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can also be installed through the command line using `install.packages()`. The package name must be wrapped in quotation marks so that R knows it is searching for that particular package named `\"psych\"`, rather than previously defined data named psych:\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is generally good to keep RStudio and your packages up to date! Install the packages we will use in the workshop:\n",
